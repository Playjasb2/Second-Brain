Game changing.

Every since it came out, it basically straight up replaced googling for me.

Constantly, whenever I try to search for anything on Google on any specific topic, sometimes I just would not be able to find precisely what I am looking for.

It could be something niche. Something that I would not be able to easily find on Stack Overflow. There were times where I would still have questions, and it would be nice to have someone to be able to answer my questions and assist me not just in programming, but in any topic that I would like to have better understanding in.

ChatGPT is an AI that would never get tired. It's always there, and it's always able to answer my questions. Granted, it can hallucinate, but it makes up for it by admitting to you that it can be wrong, and its sheer ability to explain any concept in-depth.

This is a massive breakthrough in the field of AI and ML. Literally boosted my productivity by many folds, and it helps me out in various projects.
