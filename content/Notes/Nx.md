### What is Nx?

Nx is a set of extensible dev tools for monorepos. In simpler terms, it's a toolkit that helps you manage multiple projects under a single repository (known as a monorepo). It's particularly popular for JavaScript and TypeScript-based projects, but it's not limited to them.

### Why Use Nx?

1. **Code Sharing**: Since all your projects are under one repo, you can easily share code among them without the need to publish packages to npm or manage multiple repositories.
    
2. **Build Optimizations**: Nx can intelligently build, test, and lint only the affected parts of your projects based on your changes, saving time and computational resources.
    
3. **Extensible**: Nx is built to be extensible, allowing for custom plugins and integrations with various other tools and frameworks.
