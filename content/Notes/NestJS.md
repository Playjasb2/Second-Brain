## Overview

NestJS is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It's built on top of TypeScript, but also supports modern JavaScript. It combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). NestJS takes inspiration from Angular, and hence, you'd notice a similar modular architecture in it.

## Key Features

### 1. **Modular Structure**

- NestJS promotes a modular structure, allowing developers to organize code in a highly maintainable and scalable manner.

### 2. **Dependency Injection**

- It makes extensive use of dependency injection, making it easier to manage and test different parts of an application.

### 3. **Decorators**

- Provides custom decorators to easily handle common tasks and extend the framework's functionality.

### 4. **Microservices**

- Supports microservices architecture, allowing for the development of scalable and easily maintainable applications.

### 5. **Exception Filters**

- Custom exception filters for handling exceptions in a graceful manner.

### 6. **Middleware**

- Offers middleware capabilities to execute code before the route handler.

### 7. **Interceptors**

- Interceptors for handling request/response processing.

### 8. **WebSocket, GraphQL, and REST**

- Supports various protocols and methodologies like WebSocket, GraphQL, and REST for handling different types of client-server communication.
