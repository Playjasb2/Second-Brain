[Inframodus](https://infranodus.com/) is a platform engineered for dissecting and understanding text through network analysis. Here’s a simplified breakdown of what it offers and how it operates:

### Main Features:

1. **Exploring Text Networks**:
   - At its core, Inframodus converts different types of text—like social media posts, search outcomes, company reports, news, spreadsheets, and PDFs—into network graphs. These graphs spotlight key topics and how they're interconnected, also revealing the 'knowledge gaps' where new ideas could sprout.

2. **AI-Driven Insights**:
   - Melding text mining, network scrutiny, visual display of data, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Inframodus digs deeper into text to enrich research and offer insights. It’s equipped with a GPT AI model to help fill in the blanks and broaden your understanding, presenting text analytics and visual cues to tap into visual thinking.

3. **Open-Source Nature**:
   - Brought to life by Nodus Labs, Inframodus is an open-source venture, with its development journey kicking off in 2018 (or 2011 if you count the early research and prototyping phase). It’s become a go-to tool for various research bodies and companies around the globe.

### How It Can Be Used:

- **Idea Sparking**: By spotting where the knowledge lacks, it nudges you towards new innovative thought trails
- **Feeling the Sentiment**: It’s not just about the hard facts; Inframodus helps unravel the sentiment entwined in the text, providing a richer context.
- **Boosting Research**: With its ability to turn complex text into visual, digestible data, it propels the research process forward, making it a handy companion for researchers and analyzers

### My Thoughts:

This is pretty much what I want [[Obsidian]] to be. I want to continue to expand upon my knowledge, and it would be nice from viewing it that I would see if there's gaps in my knowledge base -- This is actually the feature I'm very intrigued by in Inframodus.
