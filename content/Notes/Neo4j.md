Neo4j is a type of database management system known for its graph storage and processing capabilities. Unlike traditional relational databases which store data in tables, Neo4j stores data as nodes and relationships, allowing it to efficiently manage, query, and traverse networks of data. This makes it highly suitable for handling connected data and complex queries in domains such as social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and many other use cases where relationships between data points are crucial. 

Its core is built around a property graph model, and it employs Cypher, a declarative graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient querying and updating of the graph store. Neo4j provides a robust set of tools and libraries for working with graph data, and supports a variety of programming languages for application development.
