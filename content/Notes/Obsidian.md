Obsidian is arguably one of the best apps I have ever used when it comes to productivity.

It allows me to create a web of notes and freely lay them out as they are organically.

In fact, this is what I use for my personal knowledgement management (PKM) system, and it is in fact what I use in managing my notes for this site.
