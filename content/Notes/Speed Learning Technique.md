To learn things much faster, use the FAST method:

F - Forget what you already know about the subject, and approach it like a complete beginner. Be completely absolved with the subject in front of you.

A - Active learning. Actively engaged with yourself and actively questioning yourself as you are reading. Actively recap at the end of a module to strengthen our connections in our mind so that we can remember things better.

S - State. Aware of your emotions when you are learning. Information + Emotion = Long Term Memory. Past senses like smell or taste can help with memory. Manage your energy as supposed to managing your time. Sleep well. Eat well. Stay hydrated. Exercise regularly. Keep your energy up throughout the day.

T - Teach. If you need to learn something than you need to be able to teach it. Helps you with forming connections or seeing the subject in a different way. Helps you find gaps in your own knowledge.
